However, I can certainly escalate this issue to a supervisor and they will contact you within the next 24 hours. Can I have your contact information to pass along to them?\nCustomer: Fine! My phone number is 555-1234 and my email is johnsmith@email.com.\nAgent: Thank you, John. I have escalated your issue to a supervisor and they will be contacting you shortly.
